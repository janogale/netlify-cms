  When I got into software development, I was so excited. I wanted to learn
  everything at once: game development, mobile development, artificial
  intelligence and everything that has to do with it. I wasted time writing
  “hello world” and simple programs in about 30 languages, just to figure out
  which one I should learn.

Let’s face it; not everybody knows exactly what they want to do when they enter the software industry; or even more so, not everybody picks the right thing to make them stand out in a crowd. This is true for beginners and junior developers. But if we look deeper, it’s shocking that even those with some experience in the field also struggle. That’s mainly because software development is rapidly evolving with new tech stacks, frameworks, and languages every single year. As software developers, we, therefore, have to keep learning every single day.

Choosing the ideal path in the software industry involves considering the following:

1. Knowing what it takes to get there (learning curve, tech stack or languages)
2. Median salary
3. Work environment
4. And finally, your own personal strengths.

Based on the above criteria and the following explanations, you’ll know exactly what’s right for you. You can pick multiple paths — you can “dual-class” — but you should pick at least one to master very well. This will not simply reduce your learning curve, but will also help you land a job faster.

It’s time to focus. Let’s dive in.

# **Web Development**

This path is a very common and easy way to get into software development. Most developers fall into this category or do at least some web development. Nowadays, web development is broken down into two major categories:*front-end*(client-side) and*back-end*(server-side). In between, we have*full-stack*development, which encompasses both.

## **Front-end**

Front-end development includes everything users see in their browsers or applications. Front-end developers are responsible for the look and feel of a web application.

Required skills include designing user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and a growing collection of UI frameworks such as[React.js](https://reactjs.org/),[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/),[Angular](https://angular.io/), and others. Most of these frameworks are based on JavaScript. Barrier for entry to this role is quite, low and just requires you to pick any of the above frameworks to pair with HTML, CSS, and JS, and boom you’re ready to go. To become a front-end developer, you don’t need to pursue any formal training or get a computer science degree. In fact, most front-end web developers are self-taught or went through a boot camp. But an associate or bachelor’s degree is required to advance in the field.

## **Back-end**

Back-end is the term used for activities happening behind-the-scenes. It can be anything from signing in to an account to purchasing a phone from an online store.

Back-end development focus ondatabases, scripting, and website architecture. Code written by back-end developers helps to communicate the database information to the browser. This path is favorable for people with a computer science or software engineering background.

Entry to back-end development requires, at minimum: knowledge of a server-side language like Java, Python,[PHP](https://www.php.net/),[Golang](https://golang.org/), or Ruby;[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)or[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)(a JS framework for server-side programming); database management system (DBMS)technologies such as[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/),[Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/),[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html),[SQLserver](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx), or others; and exposure to handling servers like[Apache](https://www.apache.org/),[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), or Microsoft IIS. A good background in Linux helps tremendously in administering servers.

## **Full stack**

A full-stack developer is someone with knowledge of both front-end and back-end development, but not necessarily an expert in both. This path is suitable for*entreprogrammers*(programmer/entrepreneur hybrids). That’s good because you can quickly ship a complete product or even launch your startup using just your own skills. 

This role is in high demand by many startups which aim simply to put all those features together in a cost-effective way. Nowadays, this path is even easier for beginners. With a language like JavaScript, you can become a full-stack developer by picking a front-end framework like React.js and a back-end framework like Node.js, coupled with a popular DBMS like Mongo DB, and you’re ready to go.

The average salary of a web developer varies from one location to another. According to Glassdoor, the median annual wage for web developers in the U.S. is $75,000. The low end is less than $50,000, and the top-paid developers earn over $117,000. Most web developers work full time.
