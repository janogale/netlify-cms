***Context:***

Somalia is characterized by a complex migration crisis caused by conflict, natural disasters and a general lack of opportunities. Both conflict and natural disasters have led to the displacement of millions of people, both internally and across international borders, resulting in approximately 1 million refugees in the region and 1.1 internally displaced persons. Further, an unknown number of migrants and refugees have also left the country towards Europe and the Middle East, as well as to Southern Africa. The situation in Somalia remains volatile with recurring drought and floods and an ongoing conflict between the Federal Government of Somalia with Al-Shabaab as well as inter-clan conflicts. While the situation in Somaliland is more stable, the recent drought and influx of returnees from Yemen, as well as the large number of IDPs pose a strain on the government’s capacity to respond.

Recent gains in stability, political development and a changing environment in the neighboring countries, however, have led to an increasing number of Somalilanders/Somalis returning to their country, leading to an increasing need to improve the coping capacities of return areas but also opening up opportunities for recovery, as many returnees have skills that are direly needed in Somaliland. The potential closure of Dadaab further highlights the need for comprehensive return and reintegration programming. The conflict in Yemen has further also led to significant return of Somalilanders/Somalis who require support. Durable solutions of IDPs are increasingly on the agenda within the framework of recovery and stabilization.
